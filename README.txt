EC#1:  Improve the look of the program by using images to draw the planets and Sun, calling the appropriate functions from cs1lib. NASA has a website with public-domain photographs of planets and the Sun. The filename of the image should probably be a parameter to the __init__ method of a body, instead of the radius and color parameters. Remember that the image file needs to be in the same project as your Python code for load_image to work.
